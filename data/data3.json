However, it never crossed my mind to ask for advise  from you regarding an inquiry about my pension benefit. I worked for about 11 years when I decided to apply for SS retirement benefit in 2016 at the age of 66. That time,  i had an idea of more or less how much i will receive since the estimated amount is shown in the online SS account where I‚Äôm signed up. This is relevant to me since It wasn‚Äôt  a big amount tho‚Äô but to me it was good enough inasmuch as my income when i worked in the US was not that much. I was asked during the interview if I was receiving any pension in the Phils. which to all honesty I answered yes. I was surprised that when i received my final check i got a very small amount since the equivalent of the pension I was getting in the Phils. was deducted . I tried to call them but they said that was how it should be. The next time i attempted they asked about a record or statement of how much i was receiving which I did not have as I haven‚Äôt been home for years.  At that  time, I wasn‚Äôt a citizen yet.  At present, because of the pandemic there is no way to talk to them personally and they‚Äôre reply over the phone is still the same. I‚Äôm not quite convinced as yet why a benefit you got from another country long before you came here  will be deducted from the benefit you deserve to receive . I don‚Äôt understand the reason that it was covered by a ‚Äúwindfall‚Äù something they were explaining. In my simple thinking as an ordinary  citizen, I couldn‚Äôt understand  why a hard earned money I deserve to receive for working more  than 10 years will be affected by another benefit you are received from your home counrty. It was not even an ‚ÄúSSI‚Äù that you get for free. Pls. help  enlighten me. Thank you so much for all the help you‚Äôre doing for all your viewers.

While working I also established College 529 for my 3-children and also established Custodial Accounts with then Scottrade for my 3-children as soon as they're issued their SSN.  When I retired from U.S. Army, I had 4-properties in 2-low cost states.  One thing I learned being raised by single-mother along with 4-siblings, is to live frugal life style.  I normally bought used cars EXCEPT when I retired, I bought a brand new car - cash.  Now at age 49, I started selling properties to simplify my lifestyle.  I used to be workaholic, and now travels/cruise to enjoy fruits of my labour since I started working at 15-years young.  I'm Blessed to have no debt other than the mortgage.

{"cid": "UgyApyMJY7gDQg2Xud54AaABAg", "text": "I like the video; it's well done. However, determining when to begin receiving SSI isn't quite so simple.  While the numbers in themselves make sense, there are complications to be borne in mind.  The median average life expectancy of 62 year old men is about 25 years and 28 years for women.  What this means is that (using the 3% historic annual inflation discount), unless you have a significant illness or a family history of much shorter than average life spans, the smart move is to wait as long as you can.  Why? because every year you live beyond the break even point of 81 or 82, you will have made more money, altogether, by delaying your SSI claim.  Of course, if you have no other source of income, you'll have to begin collecting earlier than you'd like just to survive.  Another point to consider is that in most years your social security payments will be increased by a % that offsets inflation.  So, the longer you wait to collect SSI, the greater number of dollars each percentage point represents.  The analysis stops at full retirement age.  In my case, 66 years.  for each year you wait, beyond full retirement age, to begin your payments, you get an additional 8% until age 70.  So, for me (using his $$) this would be $1,320 per month at 70 rather than $1,000 at full retirement age, or $733 at 62.  If you're reasonably healthy and you have other income, it really is smart to wait til 70.  Finally, the penalty for working and collecting SSI ($2 for $1 I believe) ends at full retirement age (66).  There is no such penalty for W2 income earned after that age.

Social Security does not make partial-month payments. Unless you were born on May 1st, your first full month of eligibility is June.  Since the Social Security Administration pays individuals a month behind, the person will receive the June benefit in July. The check will arrive on the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th Wednesday, depending on your day of birth.  For example, if you were born on May 10th you will get your first payment on July 10 but if you were born one day later, May 11, you have to wait until July 17.  The shortest waiting time is for a person born on May 1 (42 days) but, the worst-case scenario is the person born the following day on May 2, who has to wait 69 days before receiving his first SS payment.  So the person born on May 1 will receive his first payment almost one whole month earlier than the person born on May 2!  So, while at first glance you might think you can get your benefits when you turn 62, the first payment does not happen until you are 62 years and 2  months old...", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "mvescuadra", "channel": "UCkB757jtHkNaAT5AzJDbwdA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnhyQEBJeugsWbZUw9KcnwwY5dIfTYcZfzwdLw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false},

Other places are far more expensive than others. I think food wise, you 'll be okay with $200/month if you plan on cooking at home. Eating out will be different of course. Not sure if you can use your benefit for housing loan in the Philippines if you decide to acquire a property. People who served has a very good discount or rate for housing loans. Not sure if you are aware of it. We have a VA ofc that you can go to in Pasay, which is in Manila ( I'm not mistaken, it is near the US embassy) and they have providers that can see you. With the New Mission Act, you can be referred to a non-VA provider if they can not address your health concern. If you have not established yourself as a pt within VA, now is the time to get to it so that you'll be in the system and hopefully, it will be much easier for you to transition there. And so, if you decide to live in the province and you'll encounter any health issues, you can see a provider locally and doesn't have to travel Manila to go to the VA ofc and they can simply make the consult/referral for you.
