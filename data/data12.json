[{"cid": "UgxsaoNkGRA3oB6FDol4AaABAg", "text": "Hello Peter, as you know me and GINA have been together for over three years now. She has never asked me for money. She is a very hard working independent woman.  Between her sari sari store and selling beer and soda to other sari sari store with free delivery. We also raise pigs, we have 12 pigs ready to sell for Christmas. Mama pig is having babies on Nov 25th and those pigs will sell at Easter time.  GINA is working about 16 hours a day right now. How I wish I was there to help her. I do send 10,000 pesos every month for our motorcycle, internet, and our bajaj payment. And she has money left over for what ever else. When I first met GINA she only had a very small sari sari store at her house. Her sari sari store is now on the main road. I can retire as soon as air travel is possible. Between both of us we are building a wonderful life together. The good lord has blessed us", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "Mark messick", "channel": "UCE-Zytcp2HY3_3gR15XuMxQ", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwninmjMnbNheddvHxLILuKk259PgvebM_XnvRuyB=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": true},

I also happen to be single (widower) and I would be open to developing a relationship. But I would certainly not do so out of desperation, as some men appear to do. But my comment is that perhaps the offer is made to see what type of reaction is generated. If there's been no previous talk of money, there's likely no immediate need for it either. And if, for example, she's hesitant or has declined the offer, then perhaps she's genuine and sincere, as you so often say that most Filipinas are.

For example if I work a minimum wage job then finding $100 a month may be hard, but if I am a CEO of a company then I could easily give $500 a month and it wouldn't be missed. The main point here is don't take away from a Filipinas pride in herself to be independent and proud to be able to look after herself. Don't make her feel like a kept woman. If she has no job or a job that only pays a little then help accordingly within your budget so you don't end up broke yourself. As I say in the video 2500 - 4000 pesos will provide the bare necessities for her to get by and again you don't want to be fully subsidising her life.", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "All About Filipina Relationships", "channel": "UCDSd4U2FQAB4XWgHMjoRrzg", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwniSFzz4Zc__tpg83YI5ARCG4uLA0Mm1-VEdsfBSkw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false},
