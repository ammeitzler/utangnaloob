{"cid": "UgwZVWogQ3pTzLGpPEB4AaABAg", "text": "The WF Portfolio program mentioned at 15:32 has two tiers: Portfolio and Portfolio Plus (WFP+).  The $4 ExpressSend fee is only waived for the WFP+, and not for the regular Portfolio.  An overall relationship (checking, savings, brokerage, retirement funds etc.) of at least $250K is required to qualify for WFP+. In Danny’s example, the difference between Wise and WFP+ would have been reduced to only PHP122, since the $4 fee is waived.\r \r But another advantage of WFP+ is international ATM fees are waived.  It is like the Schwab ATM except WFP+ waives the ATM fees on the same day of the withdrawal, instead of end of the month for Schwab. Since the ATM withdrawal in PH is based on the local bank’s exchange rate (not WF exchange rate), it is like exchanging your dollar bills at the bank, which is the best exchange rate you could get, as mentioned by Danny, but without carrying actual dollar bills.  You only carry one ATM card, whether you are in the US or somewhere else in the world.\r \r We moved some of our IRA’s from Fidelity to WF to qualify for WFP+.  Since it is a self-managed IRA, the fees and yields would have been the same, anyway, whether it is parked in Fidelity or WF.", "time": "4 days ago (edited)", "author": "Black Mamba", "channel": "UCz5S8ZRovV2bdXGHPXoIYQQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnj6M41dchwCnjW7mv8dLPZ6iQ5nvbHl0HaGoRWq=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false},
