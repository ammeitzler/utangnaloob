I have one more thing¬†to¬†add if you don't mind, that is; It's better to be using a credit cards instead of debit cards. The reason is, if some one get hold of your debit card  or even your card's info and start using it to perches some items or somehow withdrew all the money in your account (Tuff Luck) your bank will not be liable at all and say goodbye to your hard earn money. But if it was a credit card you are liable for the first fifty dollars only and your bank are responsible for the rest of the lost money .

For those that are new to the system may i recommend Remitly money transfer service. For first time users there is always promotion plus if you sign up with my referral you will also get a cash back offer on top of that. The promotion varies depending on where you send from. I myself am Australian so get $15 off and so will you if you sign up using my referral link. The other perk for first time users sending from Australia to Philippines is a promotional exchange rate and no sending fee.
