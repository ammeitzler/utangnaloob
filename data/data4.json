{"cid": "UgzxUhetf0qY_ahOH1Z4AaABAg", "text": "TransferWise is definitely a great tool to send money easily specially within European accounts as the fees are low and seems to be transparent in that way.      However, no body says anything about the transfers in USD to a USD account outside the US.   TransferWise would charge a fee of about USD4.60 to transfer your USD funds from the borderless account to a USD account outside of the US, mentioning the transfer has to be done via SWIFT.    They have a link if you navigate thoroughly on their website, where they say you can be charged up to USD50 on top as SWIFT transfers  may involve transferring the money through multiple banks.   I personally had a horrible experience being charged USD70 for a transfer from my USD Borderless account to USD account outside of the US.      On the section where you are intending to place the transfer, does not give a warning that you may be charged a huge amount of money, they just say \"additional fees may apply when transferring via SWIFT\".      Bear in mind these details, I understand people want to promote TransferWise online to get some free cash by using their link to encourage people to use it, which is great, however, whoever is intending to transfer USD to a non US bank account, you might get an awful surprise! TransferWise customer service will not make any effort to help you at all but just talk to you as you were a retarded repeating what you already know, you've been ripped off but they do not take responsibilities how much you will end up getting once the money leaves their bank account.", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Aldo Di Liberto", "channel": "UCd3tvvjiOf6sYwMGaljZf2g", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnj95H3uxd40g9Fw_3MUKg41VT2mlnAUmnBDolfpdQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false},
