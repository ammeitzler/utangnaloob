Remitly usually charges a fee for express transfers. But if you use a US bank account, there is no fee. But you need to wait for 3-4 business days for the transaction to be completed.    I'm not sure about the experience of those who say that it took 10 days but in my experience, Express (pay via debit card) service takes minutes to send to my Philippine bank account. If I use a bank account payment option, it takes about 4 business days.    For PayPal, the recipient also needs to have a PayPal account, sending to friends and family is free, although they may charge some other fees, not sure. It's been a while since I used this service.

Remitly usually charges a fee for express transfers. But if you use a US bank account, there is no fee. But you need to wait for 3-4 business days for the transaction to be completed.    I'm not sure about the experience of those who say that it took 10 days but in my experience, Express (pay via debit card) service takes minutes to send to my Philippine bank account. If I use a bank account payment option, it takes about 4 business days.    For PayPal, the recipient also needs to have a PayPal account, sending to friends and family is free, although they may charge some other fees, not sure. It's been a while since I used this service. Your recipient will then need to have a bank account connected to PayPal and from what I understand, there is also a fee for transferring money from PayPal to bank account.", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "A Mighty Life", "channel": "UChrDqD10QlwG0eZ6ZADSxNw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnim92LVuFUftjjwXCE8ngvfTLcIgtoVjd8ZCTLN=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false},

{"cid": "Ugx8AFYXoqNMb8k3BJF4AaABAg", "text": "I’ve been your regular viewer for quite sometime. However, it never crossed my mind to ask for advise  from you regarding an inquiry about my pension benefit. I worked for about 11 years when I decided to apply for SS retirement benefit in 2016 at the age of 66. That time,  i had an idea of more or less how much i will receive since the estimated amount is shown in the online SS account where I’m signed up. This is relevant to me since It wasn’t  a big amount tho’ but to me it was good enough inasmuch as my income when i worked in the US was not that much. I was asked during the interview if I was receiving any pension in the Phils. which to all honesty I answered yes. I was surprised that when i received my final check i got a very small amount since the equivalent of the pension I was getting in the Phils. was deducted . I tried to call them but they said that was how it should be. The next time i attempted they asked about a record or statement of how much i was receiving which I did not have as I haven’t been home for years.  At that  time, I wasn’t a citizen yet.  At present, because of the pandemic there is no way to talk to them personally and they’re reply over the phone is still the same. I’m not quite convinced as yet why a benefit you got from another country long before you came here  will be deducted from the benefit you deserve to receive . I don’t understand the reason that it was covered by a “windfall” something they were explaining. In my simple thinking as an ordinary  citizen, I couldn’t understand  why a hard earned money I deserve to receive for working more  than 10 years will be affected by another benefit you are received from your home counrty. It was not even an “SSI” that you get for free. Pls. help  enlighten me. Thank you so much for all the help you’re doing for all your viewers.

While in service, I used my housing allowance to buy real estate and also started investing in stock with then Datek  in late 1990s which is now TD Ameritrade.  While working I also established College 529 for my 3-children and also established Custodial Accounts with then Scottrade for my 3-children as soon as they're issued their SSN.  When I retired from U.S. Army, I had 4-properties in 2-low cost states.  One thing I learned being raised by single-mother along with 4-siblings, is to live frugal life style.  I normally bought used cars EXCEPT when I retired, I bought a brand new car - cash.  Now at age 49, I started selling properties to simplify my lifestyle.  I used to be workaholic, and now travels/cruise to enjoy fruits of my labour since I started working at 15-years young.  I'm Blessed to have no debt other than the mortgage.

{"cid": "UgyApyMJY7gDQg2Xud54AaABAg", "text": "I like the video; it's well done. However, determining when to begin receiving SSI isn't quite so simple.  While the numbers in themselves make sense, there are complications to be borne in mind.  The median average life expectancy of 62 year old men is about 25 years and 28 years for women.  What this means is that (using the 3% historic annual inflation discount), unless you have a significant illness or a family history of much shorter than average life spans, the smart move is to wait as long as you can.  Why? because every year you live beyond the break even point of 81 or 82, you will have made more money, altogether, by delaying your SSI claim.  Of course, if you have no other source of income, you'll have to begin collecting earlier than you'd like just to survive.  Another point to consider is that in most years your social security payments will be increased by a % that offsets inflation.  So, the longer you wait to collect SSI, the greater number of dollars each percentage point represents.  The analysis stops at full retirement age.  In my case, 66 years.  for each year you wait, beyond full retirement age, to begin your payments, you get an additional 8% until age 70.  So, for me (using his $$) this would be $1,320 per month at 70 rather than $1,000 at full retirement age, or $733 at 62.  If you're reasonably healthy and you have other income, it really is smart to wait til 70.  Finally, the penalty for working and collecting SSI ($2 for $1 I believe) ends at full retirement age (66).  There is no such penalty for W2 income earned after that age.

Despite the SSA pronouncement that you can start receiving benefits when you turn 62, you actually only start to receive the money when you are 62 years and 2 months old.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "mvescuadra", "channel": "UCkB757jtHkNaAT5AzJDbwdA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnhyQEBJeugsWbZUw9KcnwwY5dIfTYcZfzwdLw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false},

Social Security does not make partial-month payments. Unless you were born on May 1st, your first full month of eligibility is June.  Since the Social Security Administration pays individuals a month behind, the person will receive the June benefit in July. The check will arrive on the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th Wednesday, depending on your day of birth.  For example, if you were born on May 10th you will get your first payment on July 10 but if you were born one day later, May 11, you have to wait until July 17.  The shortest waiting time is for a person born on May 1 (42 days) but, the worst-case scenario is the person born the following day on May 2, who has to wait 69 days before receiving his first SS payment.  So the person born on May 1 will receive his first payment almost one whole month earlier than the person born on May 2!

My returned to Phil last month was my longest away since I left in 1979 and now Philippines is calling me to come home. Here's my biggest concen. I don't have any large savings and relying only on my US Social Security with projected age at 62 with $1353. I'm also a U.S. Army Veteran so I think maybe I can find a little credit if I go to one of the Veterans Clinic for health coverage.

If you decide to live in Manila, I think you're main concern will be housing. The price for the condo unit back in 2012 has tremendously increased. But between $400-700 monthly rent will be a very nice house/apartment . Less if you choose a smaller one and of course it also depends where in Manila. Other places are far more expensive than others. I think food wise, you 'll be okay with $200/month if you plan on cooking at home. Eating out will be different of course. Not sure if you can use your benefit for housing loan in the Philippines if you decide to acquire a property. People who served has a very good discount or rate for housing loans. Not sure if you are aware of it. We have a VA ofc that you can go to in Pasay, which is in Manila ( I'm not mistaken, it is near the US embassy) and they have providers that can see you. With the New Mission Act, you can be referred to a non-VA provider if they can not address your health concern. If you have not established yourself as a pt within VA, now is the time to get to it so that you'll be in the system and hopefully, it will be much easier for you to transition there. And so, if you decide to live in the province and you'll encounter any health issues, you can see a provider locally and doesn't have to travel Manila to go to the VA ofc and they can simply make the consult/referral for you. At least, this is how I understand it. Better to ask the VA still.

I just got lucky, i have a condo at BGC, Taguig which i acquired back in 2012. the 60sqm condo doubled in value.  location, location, location.  hehehe BGC is like living in the states, you have nice restaurants, shopping centers, BPO offices, hospital, movie theaters and most important you feel safe.. No tricycle too and night life can be expensive though. a bucket of 6-bottles of san miguel light beer for 300pesos or $6.. hehehe we are blessed having a choice at age 62 for our social security pension, other country don't, its age 65/66.

{"cid": "UgzxUhetf0qY_ahOH1Z4AaABAg", "text": "TransferWise is definitely a great tool to send money easily specially within European accounts as the fees are low and seems to be transparent in that way.      However, no body says anything about the transfers in USD to a USD account outside the US.   TransferWise would charge a fee of about USD4.60 to transfer your USD funds from the borderless account to a USD account outside of the US, mentioning the transfer has to be done via SWIFT.    They have a link if you navigate thoroughly on their website, where they say you can be charged up to USD50 on top as SWIFT transfers  may involve transferring the money through multiple banks.   I personally had a horrible experience being charged USD70 for a transfer from my USD Borderless account to USD account outside of the US.      On the section where you are intending to place the transfer, does not give a warning that you may be charged a huge amount of money, they just say \"additional fees may apply when transferring via SWIFT\".      Bear in mind these details, I understand people want to promote TransferWise online to get some free cash by using their link to encourage people to use it, which is great, however, whoever is intending to transfer USD to a non US bank account, you might get an awful surprise! TransferWise customer service will not make any effort to help you at all but just talk to you as you were a retarded repeating what you already know, you've been ripped off but they do not take responsibilities how much you will end up getting once the money leaves their bank account.", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Aldo Di Liberto", "channel": "UCd3tvvjiOf6sYwMGaljZf2g", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnj95H3uxd40g9Fw_3MUKg41VT2mlnAUmnBDolfpdQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false},

I myself have been using numerous methods to access money from my home country here in the Philippines for the past few years since I been living here. For those that are new to the system may i recommend Remitly money transfer service. For first time users there is always promotion plus if you sign up with my referral you will also get a cash back offer on top of that. The promotion varies depending on where you send from. I myself am Australian so get $15 off and so will you if you sign up using my referral link. The other perk for first time users sending from Australia to Philippines is a promotional exchange rate and no sending fee.

An overall relationship (checking, savings, brokerage, retirement funds etc.) of at least $250K is required to qualify for WFP+. In Danny’s example, the difference between Wise and WFP+ would have been reduced to only PHP122, since the $4 fee is waived.\r \r But another advantage of WFP+ is international ATM fees are waived.  It is like the Schwab ATM except WFP+ waives the ATM fees on the same day of the withdrawal, instead of end of the month for Schwab. Since the ATM withdrawal in PH is based on the local bank’s exchange rate (not WF exchange rate), it is like exchanging your dollar bills at the bank, which is the best exchange rate you could get, as mentioned by Danny, but without carrying actual dollar bills.  You only carry one ATM card, whether you are in the US or somewhere else in the world.\r \r We moved some of our IRA’s from Fidelity to WF to qualify for WFP+.
